		<p>This page describes the fosm privacy policy. It describes what personal 
		information we may be gathering from you, who can see this information, and 
		what options you have for controlling this.</p>

		<h2>Community development</h2>

		<p>Development of the software behind fosm is a community effort, with many 
		developers involved and work taking place on many separate components. Generally 
		a good level of care is being taken to ensure that personal information of 
		mappers contributing to the project, will not fall into the wrong hands.</p>

		<h2>Email Addresses</h2>

		<p>The registered email address for a fosm user account, will never intentionally be 
		published on the internet anywhere, shared with third party organisations, or revealed 
		directly to other logged-in users. Only System Administrators will have direct access 
		to email address data. It may be used by these people to contact users directly about 
		their edits or other fosm related issues.</p>

		<h2>Map Data</h2>

		<p>All edits made to the map are recorded in the database with the user ID of 
		the user making the change, and a timestamp at the time of change upload. In 
		general all of this information is also made available to everyone via the website, 
		including links to allow everyone to easily cross-reference which user has made which edit.</p>

		<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

		<p>Please note that for users subscribing to public fosm mailing lists, their email 
		address may well be visible to other mailing list members depending on the software used. 
		If this is a problem for you then please create a disposable email address to use with 
		the mailing lists.</p>
